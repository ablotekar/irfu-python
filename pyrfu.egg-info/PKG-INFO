        # pyRFU
        
        pyRFU is a software based on the IRFU-MATLAB library to work with space data, particularly the Magnetospheric MultiScale (MMS) mission. 
        
        
        # Instalation
        pyRFU supports Windows, macOS and Linux. 
        
        ## Requirements
        pyRFU uses packages not included in python3. To get started, install the required packages using :
        
        ```python
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```
        
        ## From TestPyPi
        pyRFU uses TestPyPI a separate instance of the Python Package index to not affect the real index. To get started, install the pyrfu package using TestPyPI:
        
        ```python
        pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/project/ --no-deps pyrfu 
        ```
        
        
        # Usage
        To import generic space plasma physics functions
        ```python
        from pyrfu import pyrf
        ```
        
        To import functions specific to MMS mission
        ```python
        from pyrfu import mms
        ```
        
        To import plotting functions
        ```python
        from pyrfu import plot as pltrf
        ```
        
        # Configuration
        
        Configuration settings are set in the CONFIG hash table in the mms_config.py file.
        
        # Credits 
        This software was developped by Louis RICHARD (louisr@irfu.se) based on the IRFU-MATLAB library.
