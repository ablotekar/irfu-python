	abstract = {Recent multi-spacecraft studies of solar wind discontinuity crossings using the timing (boundary plane triangulation) method gave boundary parameter estimates that are signiﬁcantly different from those of the well-established single-spacecraft minimum variance analysis (MVA) technique. A large survey of directional discontinuities in Cluster data turned out to be particularly inconsistent in the sense that multi-point timing analyses did not identify any rotational discontinuities (RDs) whereas the MVA results of the individual spacecraft suggested that RDs form the majority of events. To make multi-spacecraft studies of discontinuity crossings more conclusive, the present report addresses the accuracy of the timing approach to boundary parameter estimation. Our error analysis is based on the reciprocal vector formalism and takes into account uncertainties both in crossing times and in the spacecraft positions. A rigorous error estimation scheme is presented for the general case of correlated crossing time errors and arbitrary spacecraft conﬁgurations. Crossing time error covariances are determined through cross correlation analyses of the residuals. The principal inﬂuence of the spacecraft array geometry on the accuracy of the timing method is illustrated using error formulas for the simpliﬁed case of mutually uncorrelated and identical errors at different spacecraft. The full error analysis procedure is demonstrated for a solar wind discontinuity as observed by the Cluster FGM instrument.},

	abstract = {Measurements from the closely spaced Cluster spacecraft are used to study the structure of the magnetic and electric ﬁelds within the magnetic ramp of dipolarization fronts (DF) observed close to the neutral sheet and the midnight meridian (YGSM {\textless} 3 RE). The spacecraft separation was small enough ({\textless}300 km) to treat the magnetic ramp of the DF front as a planar structure as indicated from variance analysis. The ﬁnite value of the magnetic ﬁeld along the minimum variance direction for the events studied indicates that the dipolarization front structure was distinct from a tangential discontinuity. In addition to the main increase of the magnetic ﬁeld in the maximum variance component, strong oscillations were observed in the intermediate component. The presence of this oscillatory structure results in an expansion of the region in which a change of magnetic pressure occurs, the size of which is typically an ion Larmor radius or greater. This widening is important in maintaining the pressure balance at the edge of the DF. This phenomenon resembles observations of intense current sheets in the magnetotail and also laboratory experiments of current sheet formation, in which a similar widening of the ramp region has been observed. In this paper we argue against the idea that an electron temperature anisotropy, resulting in electron curvature currents, can explain the formation of the oscillatory structures observed at DFs. These oscillations can be explained as eigenmode waves of the plasma that propagate away from the disturbance (DF) that is moving at subsonic speeds. Oscillations observed within the magnetic ramp indicate ﬁeld-aligned currents that are expected to be associated with DF.},

This subject will be treated within the context of the expanding solar wind and the most meaningful advances in this research field will be reported emphasizing the results obtained in the past decade or so. As a matter of fact, Helios inner heliosphere and Ulysses’ high latitude observations, recent multi-spacecrafts measurements in the solar wind (Cluster four satellites) and new numerical approaches to the problem, based on the dynamics of complex systems, brought new important insights which helped to better understand how turbulent fluctuations behave in the solar wind. In particular, numerical simulations within the realm of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence theory unraveled what kind of physical mechanisms are at the basis of turbulence generation and energy transfer across the spectral domain of the fluctuations. In other words, the advances reached in these past years in the investigation of solar wind turbulence now offer a rather complete picture of the phenomenological aspect of the problem to be tentatively presented in a rather organic way.},

Numerical simulations indicate that such current sheets are important sites of energy dissipation and particle heating occurring at kinetic scales. However, direct evidence of dissipation and associated heating within current sheets is scarce. Here, we show a new statistical study of local electron heating within proton-scale current sheets by using high-resolution spacecraft data. Current sheets are detected using the Partial Variance of Increments (PVI) method which identiﬁes regions of strong intermittency. We ﬁnd that strong electron heating occurs in high PVI ({\textgreater}3) current sheets while no signiﬁcant heating occurs in low PVI cases ({\textless}3), indicating that the former are dominant for energy dissipation. Current sheets corresponding to very high PVI ({\textgreater}5) show the strongest heating and most of the time are consistent with ongoing magnetic reconnection. This suggests that reconnection is important for electron heating and dissipation at kinetic scales in turbulent plasmas.},

Despite their diﬀerent physical scales (in size, velocity, and amount of energy transported), they have strong morphological similarities. What physics do they share? These systems are either hydrodynamic or magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) in nature and are, as such, governed by non-linear equations. While theoretical models helped us to understand the basic physics of these objects, numerical simulations have been allowing us to go beyond the one-dimensional, steady-state approach extracting vital information. In this lecture, the formation, structure, and evolution of the jets are reviewed with the help of observational information, MHD and purely hydrodynamical modeling, and numerical simulations. Possible applications of the models particularly to YSOs and AGN jets are addressed.},

We determine the frequency and phase velocity of these structures in the reference frame of the front and identify them as a manifestation of the lower hybrid drift instability (LHDI) excited at the sharp density gradient at the front. The LHDI is observed in the nonlinear stage of its evolution as the electrostatic potential of the structures is comparable to ∼ 10\% of the electron temperature. The front appears to be a coherent structure on ion and MHD scales, suggesting existence of a dynamic equilibrium between excitation of the LHDI and recovery of the steep density gradient at the front.},

The nonlinear effects, multiscale and microphysical interactions inherent to the ﬂow-driven instabilities, are believed to play a role, e.g., in plasma entry across a discontinuity, generation of turbulence, and enhanced drag. However, in order to clarify the efﬁciency of macroscopic instabilities in these processes, we lack proper knowledge of their overall morphological features. Here we show the ﬁrst observations of the temporally and spatially resolved evolution of the magnetic Kelvin–Helmholtz instability in the solar corona. Unprecedented high-resolution imaging observations of vortices developing at the surface of a fast coronal mass ejecta are taken by the new Solar Dynamics Observatory, validating theories of the nonlinear dynamics involved. The new ﬁndings are a cornerstone for developing a unifying theory on ﬂow-driven instabilities in rareﬁed magnetized plasmas, which is important for understanding the fundamental processes at work in key regions of the Sun–Earth system.},

	abstract = {A semi-analytic model of cluster cooling ﬂows is presented. The model assumes that episodic nuclear activity followed by radiative cooling without mass-dropout cycles the cluster gas between a relatively homogeneous, nearly isothermal post-outburst state and a cuspy conﬁguration in which a cooling catastrophe initiates the next nuclear outburst. Fitting the model to Chandra data for the Hydra cluster, a lower limit of 284 Myr until the next outburst of Hydra A is derived. Density, temperature and emission-measure proﬁles at several times prior to the cooling catastrophe are presented. It proves possible to ﬁt the mass M(σ ) with entropy index Pρ−γ less than σ to a simple power-law form, which is almost invariant as the cluster cools. We show that radiative cooling automatically establishes this power-law form if the entropy index was constant throughout the cluster gas at some early epoch or after an active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity cycle. To high precision, the central value of σ decreases linearly with time. The fraction of clusters in a magnitude-limited sample that have gas cooler than T is calculated, and is shown to be small for T = 2 keV. Similarly, only 1 per cent of clusters in such a sample contain gas with Pρ−γ {\textless} 2 keV cm2. Entropy production in shocks is shown to be small. The entropy that is radiated from the cluster can be replaced if a few per cent of the cluster gas passes through bubbles heated during an outburst of the AGN.},

We ﬁnd that the major energy conversion is happening in the Earth (laboratory) frame, where the electromagnetic energy is being transferred from the electromagnetic ﬁeld to particles. This process operates in a region with size of the order several ion inertial lengths across the jet front, and the primary contribution to E ⋅ j is coming from the motional electric ﬁeld and the ion current. In the frame of the front we ﬁnd ﬂuctuating energy conversion with localized loads and generators at sub-ion scales which are primarily related to the lower hybrid drift instability excited at the front; however, these provide relatively small net energy conversion.},

	abstract = {Plasma turbulence is thought to be associated with various physical processes involved in solar ﬂares, including magnetic reconnection, particle acceleration, and transport. Using RHESSI observations and the X-ray visibility analysis, we determine the spatial and spectral distributions of energetic electrons for a ﬂare (GOES M3.7 class, 2002 April 14, 23:55 UT), which was previously found to be consistent with a reconnection scenario. It is demonstrated that because of the high density plasma in the loop, electrons have to be continuously accelerated about the loop apex of length ∼2 × 109 cm and width ∼7 × 108 cm. Energy-dependent transport of tens of keV electrons is observed to occur both along and across the guiding magnetic ﬁeld of the loop. We show that the crossﬁeld transport is consistent with the presence of magnetic turbulence in the loop, where electrons are accelerated, and estimate the magnitude of the ﬁeld line diffusion coefﬁcient for different phases of the ﬂare. The energy density of magnetic ﬂuctuations is calculated for given magnetic ﬁeld correlation lengths and is larger than the energy density of the non-thermal electrons. The level of magnetic ﬂuctuations peaks when the largest number of electrons is accelerated and is below detectability or absent at the decay phase. These hard X-ray observations provide the ﬁrst observational evidence that magnetic turbulence governs the evolution of energetic electrons in a dense ﬂaring loop and is suggestive of their turbulent acceleration.},

	abstract = {Dipolarization front (DF)—a sharp boundary with scale of ion inertial length (c/ωpi) in the Earth’s magnetotail—can also have ﬁne structures at electron scale (c/ωpe). Such electron-scale structures, determining the local energy conversion, have not been revealed by multispacecraft observations so far, due to the large separation of spacecraft in previous studies. Here we report the ﬁrst electron-scale multispacecraft measurements of DF, using data from the recent Magnetospheric Multiscale mission. We ﬁnd strong parallel currents only in the high-density side of the DF but strong perpendicular currents across the whole DF. We ﬁnd no parallel electric ﬁelds during the DF interval. Although DF is primarily an energy-load region (E·J {\textgreater} 0), the electron-scale currents could lead to a localized energy generation (E·J {\textless} 0). Such features are different from those reported in previous multispacecraft studies, where the currents, electric ﬁelds, and energy conversion are uniform across the DF; they also shed lights on the study of substorm current wedge, which is crucial in the magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling. Plain Language Summary Dipolarization front (DF)—a magnetotail transient structure with scale of ion inertial length—is typically characterized by the sharp, large-amplitude increase of magnetic ﬁeld Bz. DF can play a crucial role in ﬂux transport and energy conversion during substorms. Studying the DF dynamics is of particular interest for the magnetotail physics. To date, DF structure at ion scale has been well investigated by spacecraft observations and numerical simulations, while DF structure at electron scale remains not fully understood due to instrumental limitations and spacecraft separation distances. In this study, we present the ﬁrst electron-scale multispacecraft measurements of DF by using high-resolution data from the recent Magnetospheric Multiscale mission. Different from previous multispacecraft studies where the currents, electric ﬁelds, and energy conversion are uniform across the DF, we ﬁnd strong parallel currents only in the high-density side of the DF but strong perpendicular currents across the whole DF, no parallel electric ﬁelds during the DF interval, and a localized energy generation resulting from electron-scale currents. Our study demonstrates that electron-scale substructures of currents and electric ﬁelds can play an important role in magnetotail dynamics.},

Simultaneous spectra of magnetic and electric ﬁelds in the Earth’s magnetosheath from magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) to electron scales are presented for the ﬁrst time. While the two spectra have approximatively similar behaviour in the ﬂuid-MHD regime, they show different trends in the kinetic range. As the magnetic ﬁeld spectrum steepens at ion scales, the electric ﬁeld spectrum is characterized by a shallower power law continuing down to electron scales. Such an evolution is consistent with theoretical expectations, assuming that the turbulence is dominated by highly oblique k-vectors and that between ion and electron scales the electric ﬁeld is governed by the non-ideal terms in the generalized Ohm’s law. This leads to an expected linear increase of the electric-to-magnetic ratio of ﬂuctuations, consistent with observations presented here. The inﬂuence of local whistler wave activity on electron-scale spectra is also discussed.},

We show explicitly that work done by electromagnetic ﬁelds on the particles, J · E, has a non-Gaussian distribution and is concentrated in regions of high electric current density. Hence, magnetic energy is converted to kinetic energy in an intermittent manner. Furthermore, we ﬁnd that the higher-order statistics of magnetic ﬁeld ﬂuctuations generated by reconnection are characterized by multifractal scaling on magnetoﬂuid scales and non-Gaussian global scale invariance on kinetic scales. These observations suggest that J · E within the reconnection jet has an analog in ﬂuid-like turbulence theory in that it proceeds via coherent structures generated by an intermittent cascade. This supports the hypothesis that turbulent dissipation is highly nonuniform, and thus these results could have far reaching implications for space and astrophysical plasmas.},

	abstract = {Long-lived, stable jets are observed in a wide variety of systems, from protostars, through Galactic compact objects to active galactic nuclei (AGN). Magnetic ﬁelds play a central role in launching, accelerating, and collimating the jets through various media. The termination of jets in molecular clouds or the interstellar medium deposits enormous amounts of mechanical energy and momentum, and their interactions with the external medium, as well, in many cases, as the radiation processes by which they are observed, are intimately connected with the magnetic ﬁelds they carry. This review focuses on the properties and structures of magnetic ﬁelds in long-lived jets, from their launch from rotating magnetized young stars, black holes, and their accretion discs, to termination and beyond. We compare the results of theory, numerical simulations, and observations of these diverse systems and address similarities and differences between relativistic and non-relativistic jets in protostellar versus AGN systems. On the observational side, we focus primarily on jets driven by AGN because of the strong observational constraints on their magnetic ﬁeld properties, and we discuss the links between the physics of these jets on all scales.},

The strongest acceleration is reached at the location of Bz maxima inside the magnetic pile-up region where the reconnection jet stops. Very strong localized dawn-dusk electric ﬁeld are observed within the magnetic pile-up regions and are associated to most of the magnetic ﬂux transport.},

	abstract = {We report on a ﬂapping motion event near the substorm onset on 17 June 2017 using Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission data. A strong current density with a maximum value of {\textasciitilde}190 nA/m2 is observed during the ﬂapping. The north‐to‐south (south‐to‐north) crossing of the neutral sheet corresponds to an increase (a decrease) of the ZGSM component of the solar wind VZ, SW. The periods ({\textasciitilde}8 min) of the ﬂapping and variations of VZ, SW are almost equal. In addition, dVZ, SW/dt and dBX/dt observed by MMS exhibit a strong negative correlation. These observations suggest that the ﬂapping motions are triggered by the solar wind directional change via creating a motion of the current sheet in the north‐south direction. The pressure difference between the northern and southern lobes caused by the solar wind is expected to be a possible contribution to the formation of the ﬂapping. Plain language summary Flapping motions are large‐amplitude waves of the magnetotail current sheet in the north‐south direction. These waves are believed to be excited in the magnetotail center and then propagate to its ﬂanks. However, their generation mechanisms are not fully understood so far. In this study, we investigate the relation between a ﬂapping motion event and the solar wind parameters. We ﬁnd that there is a one‐to‐one correspondence between temporal variations of the ﬂapping and the ZGSM component of the solar wind velocity VZ, SW. Moreover, the vertical movement of the ion ﬂow is also in accordance with VZ, SW. These observations suggest that the ﬂapping can be generated by the solar wind directional change. During the ﬂapping, a strong current density with a maximum value of {\textasciitilde}190 nA/m2 is generated, much larger than the current reported by previous studies.},

The database includes 78 crossings, specially selected to apply multi-point data analysis techniques to calculate vector derivatives. Observed bipolar variations of jz, often with {\textbar}jz{\textbar}{\textgreater}jy, indicate that the electric currents follow kinks of the current sheet. The current density varies between 5–25 nA/m2. The half-thickness of the current sheet during ﬂapping varies over a wide range, from 1 to 20 ion thermal gyroradii (Lcp, calculated from average temperature and lobe magnetic ﬁeld for each crossing). We found no relationship between the tilt angle of the current sheet normal and the half-thickness. In 68 cases the magnetic ﬁeld curvature vector has a positive (earthward) X-component. Ten cases with a negative (tailward) curvature, associated with reconnection, were detected within 0{\textless}YGSM {\textless}7 RE. The minimum curvature radii vary mainly between 1 and 10 Lcp, and the adiabaticity parameter κ≤1 for 73\% of the events. The electric current density during ﬂapping is often off-central, i.e. the main current density is shifted from the neutral sheet ({\textbar}Bx{\textbar}{\textless}5 nT) to the Northern or Southern Hemisphere. This is most likely a temporal effect related to the ﬂapping. The analysis shows that the ﬂapping motion of the current sheet is associated with kink-like waves on the sheet surface. The kink fronts, tilted in the Y −Z plane, moved toward dawn in the morning half and toward dusk in the evening half of the magnetotail.},

Current sheet oscillations are observed both before reconnection and during it. The speed of the ﬂapping motions is found to increase when the current sheet undergoes the transition from quiet to active state, as suggested by an earlier statistical result and now conﬁrmed within one single event. Within the diffusion region both the tailward and earthward parts of the quadrupolar magnetic Hall structure are recorded as an x-line passes Cluster. We report the ﬁrst observations of the Hall structure conforming to the kinks in the current sheet.

	abstract = {In this research, the geometrical structures of tilted current sheet and tail ﬂapping waves have been analysed based on multiple spacecraft measurements and some features of the tilted current sheets have been made clear for the ﬁrst time. The geometrical features of the tilted current sheet revealed in this investigation are as follows: (1) The magnetic ﬁeld lines (MFLs) in the tilted current sheet are generally plane curves and the osculating planes in which the MFLs lie are about vertical to the equatorial plane, while the normal of the tilted current sheet leans severely to the dawn or dusk side. (2) The tilted current sheet may become very thin, the half thickness of its neutral sheet is generally much less than the minimum radius of the curvature of the MFLs. (3) In the neutral sheet, the ﬁeld-aligned current density becomes very large and has a maximum value at the center of the current sheet. (4) In some cases, the current density is a bifurcated one, and the two humps of the current density often superpose two peaks in the gradient of magnetic strength, indicating that the magnetic gradient drift current is possibly responsible for the formation of the two humps of the current density in some tilted current sheets. Tilted current sheets often appear along with tail current sheet ﬂapping waves. It is found that, in the tail ﬂapping current sheets, the minimum curvature radius of the MFLs in the current sheet is rather large with values around 1 RE, while the neutral sheet may be very thin, with its half thickness being several tenths of RE. During the ﬂapping waves, the current sheet is tilted substantially, and the maximum tilt angle is generally larger than 45◦. The phase velocities of these ﬂapping waves are several tens km/s, while their periods and wavelengths are several tens of minutes, and several earth radii, respectively.},

	abstract = {Flapping motion of the current sheets of planetary magnetotails is a common dynamic phenomenon. Previous studies of the Earth’s magnetotail suggest that its ﬂapping motion has two forms, that is, kink-like ﬂapping that can propagate as waves toward both ﬂanks and steady ﬂapping that moves up and down but does not propagate. Although some models have been proposed to explain the kink-like ﬂapping, its mechanism remains unclear. This paper surveys 87 ﬂapping events statistically with respect to their ﬂapping types, using the multipoint measurements of Cluster. The statistical results show that the up-down steady ﬂapping events tend to occur around the midnight region, and the kink-like ﬂapping events tend to occur near both ﬂanks of the magnetotail. Thus, we propose that kink-like ﬂapping motion is causally related to steady ﬂapping motion; that is, the up and down motion of steady ﬂapping around the midnight region induces kink-like ﬂapping waves, which propagate toward both ﬂanks of the magnetotail. Plain Language Summary The ﬂapping motion of Earth’s magnetotail current sheet is widely observed as a common dynamic phenomenon. As an important dynamic process for releasing the magnetospheric energy, ﬂapping motion has drawn attention increasingly. The mechanism to drive the ﬂapping motion, however, remains unclear although many models and theories have been proposed. Recent study suggested that the ﬂapping motion has two types, that is, kink-like ﬂapping and steady ﬂapping. Most previous studies are focused on the kink-like ﬂapping, and steady ﬂapping has received less attention.},

Knowledge about the ﬂapping motion of current sheet is essential to explore the related magnetotail dynamic processes, e.g., plasma instabilities. Due to the inability of single-point measurements to separate the spatial-temporal variation of magnetic ﬁeld, the moving velocity of ﬂapping current sheets cannot be revealed generally until the multipoint measurements are available, e.g., the Cluster mission. Therefore, currently, the ﬂapping behaviors are hard to be resolved only relying on single-point magnetic ﬁeld analysis. In this study, with minimum variance analysis, we develop a technique based on single-point magnetic ﬁeld measurement to qualitatively diagnose the ﬂapping properties including the ﬂapping type and the traveling direction of kink-like ﬂapping. The comparison with Cluster multipoint analysis via several case studies demonstrates that this technique is applicable; it should, however, be used with caution especially when the local sheet surface is either quasi-horizontal, or quasi-vertical. This technique will be useful for the planetary magnetotail exploration where no multipoint observations are available.},

	abstract = {A kink-like ﬂapping event of Earth magnetotail current sheet, which consists of two frequency bands successively, is studied by the multipoint observations of Cluster. The multipoint analysis of Cluster observations demonstrates that the higher frequency band (period is about 10 min) has faster propagation velocity (about 30 km/s), shorter wavelength (about 3 RE), and smaller amplitude (1–1.5 RE). In contrast, the lower frequency band (period is about 22 min) shows slower propagation velocity (about 21 km/s), longer wavelength (about 4.4 RE), and larger amplitude (2–3 RE). Comparison with the ﬂapping models demonstrates that the dispersion of theoretical models does not show consistency with the results of this event, which suggests that new or more advanced kink-like ﬂapping theories or models in the future have to consider the constraints of the dispersive properties demonstrated by this event. Plain Language Summary The morphology of the elongated geomagnetic ﬁeld in the downstream, called as magnetotail, implies presence of a current sheet near equator where magnetic ﬁeld reverses its direction. Earlier studies demonstrate that the local current sheet often moves or ﬂaps up and down, resulting in multiple crossings of current sheet as observed by spacecraft. As an important dynamic process for releasing the magnetospheric energy, ﬂapping motion has drawn attention increasingly. Observations in the past decade demonstrate that the ﬂapping motion of magnetotail current sheet can propagate from midnight toward both ﬂanks with velocities of a few tens of kilometers per second, but the physics of propagation remains unclear though some theories or models have been presented. Here with a fortunately selected ﬂapping event, which comprises two frequency bands successively observed by Cluster tetrahedron, we showed for the ﬁrst time that the propagation of ﬂapping waves is dispersive that the ﬂapping waves with higher frequency band have faster propagation velocity, shorter wavelength, smaller amplitude, and vice versa. The revealed dispersion properties are inconsistent with the current models. Thus, new or more advanced ﬂapping theories or models are required in the future considering the constraints of the dispersive properties demonstrated by this study.},

The multispacecraft analysis suggests a corrugated current sheet structure, interpreted as due to a ﬂapping motion that propagates along geocentric solar magnetospheric along the +y direction in the Geocentric Solar Magnetospheric (GSM) coordinate. The electric ﬁeld (E) and ion distributions have similarities with those in a planar current sheet. Energetic ions move along the current direction, suggesting the acceleration by the observed reconnection E during the meandering motion. Counterstreaming ions along the current sheet normal suggest the acceleration by the Hall E that is observed to be the dominant component. However, at certain locations, E and counterstreaming ions signiﬁcantly deviate from the local normal direction, and more than one pair of counterstreaming populations exist, possibly because the corrugated current sheet enables ions entering the current sheet at different locations with different velocities to mix together.},

The jet is found to separate initially into two segments of width ∼10–15di each (di is the ion inertia length). The dawnward segment moves ahead of the duskward one and continues to intensify, while the latter is buﬀeted by the return ﬂows generated by the former and stagnates. The leading front develops the characteristic structure of a sharp Bz increase and density drop on a 1–2di scale. The current associated with this Bz increase is carried mainly by the electrons, and the jet front is the site of a Region 1 sense ﬁeld-aligned current system. The ions develop a moderate temperature anisotropy with Ti{\textbar}{\textbar} {\textgreater} Ti⟂ ahead of the front, while the electron temperature remains isotropic. The ion heating behind the front is quasi-adiabatic, while the nonthermal electron tail is enhanced out to the limit of the simulation spectrum (∼15Eth). The ion velocity distribution function behind the front exhibits a strong parallel phase space enhancement at speeds ∼ 0.5VA associated with the earthward ﬂow, while closer to the dipole region there is a drop out in parallel phase space at speeds of ∼1.5–2.5VA. The electron distribution is isotropic with an enhanced central plateau extending out to ∼ 4VA.},

	abstract = {A key process in the interaction of magnetospheres with the solar wind is the explosive release of energy stored in the magnetotail. Based on observational evidence, magnetic reconnection is widely believed to be responsible. However, the very possibility of spontaneous reconnection in collisionless magnetotail plasmas has been questioned in kinetic theory for more than three decades. In addition, in situ observations by multispacecraft missions (e.g., THEMIS) reveal the development of buoyancy and ﬂapping motions coexisting with reconnection. Never before have kinetic simulations reproduced all three primary modes in realistic 2-D conﬁgurations with a ﬁnite normal magnetic ﬁeld. Moreover, 3-D simulations with closed boundaries suggest that the tail activity is dominated by buoyancy-driven instabilities, whereas reconnection is a secondary eﬀect strongly localized in the dawn-dusk direction. In this paper, we use massively parallel 3-D fully kinetic simulations with open boundaries to show that suﬃciently far from the planet explosive processes in the tail are dominated by reconnection motions. These motions occur in the form of spontaneously generated dipolarization fronts accompanied by changes in magnetic topology which extend in the dawn-dusk direction over the size of the simulation box, suggesting that reconnection onset causes a macroscale reconﬁguration of the real magnetotail. In our simulations, buoyancy and ﬂapping motions signiﬁcantly disturb the primary dipolarization front but neither destroy it nor change the near 2-D picture of the front evolution critically. Consistent with recent multiprobe observations, dipolarization fronts are also found to be the main regions of energy conversion in the magnetotail.},

	abstract = {Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS), a NASA four-spacecraft constellation mission launched on March 12, 2015, will investigate magnetic reconnection in the boundary regions of the Earth’s magnetosphere, particularly along its dayside boundary with the solar wind and the neutral sheet in the magnetic tail. The most important goal of MMS is to conduct a deﬁnitive experiment to determine what causes magnetic ﬁeld lines to reconnect in a collisionless plasma. The signiﬁcance of the MMS results will extend far beyond the Earth’s magnetosphere because reconnection is known to occur in interplanetary space and in the solar corona where it is responsible for solar ﬂares and the disconnection events known as coronal mass ejections. Active research is also being conducted on reconnection in the laboratory and speciﬁcally in magnetic-conﬁnement fusion devices in which it is a limiting factor in achieving and maintaining electron temperatures high enough to initiate fusion. Finally, reconnection is proposed as the cause of numerous phenomena throughout the universe such as comet-tail disconnection events, magnetar ﬂares, supernova ejections, and dynamics of neutron-star accretion disks. The MMS mission design is focused on answering speciﬁc questions about reconnection at the Earth’s magnetosphere. The prime focus of the mission is on determining the kinetic processes occurring in the electron diffusion region that are responsible for reconnection and that determine how it is initiated; but the mission will also place that physics into the context of the broad spectrum of physical processes associated with reconnection. Connections to other disciplines such as solar physics, astrophysics, and laboratory plasma physics are expected to be made through theory and modeling as informed by the MMS results.},

	abstract = {The FIELDS instrumentation suite on the Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission provides comprehensive measurements of the full vector magnetic and electric ﬁelds in the reconnection regions investigated by MMS, including the dayside magnetopause and the night-side magnetotail acceleration regions out to 25 Re. Six sensors on each of the four MMS spacecraft provide overlapping measurements of these ﬁelds with sensitive crosscalibrations both before and after launch. The FIELDS magnetic sensors consist of redundant ﬂux-gate magnetometers (AFG and DFG) over the frequency range from DC to 64 Hz, a search coil magnetometer (SCM) providing AC measurements over the full whistler mode spectrum expected to be seen on MMS, and an Electron Drift Instrument (EDI) that calibrates offsets for the magnetometers. The FIELDS three-axis electric ﬁeld measurements are provided by two sets of biased double-probe sensors (SDP and ADP) operating in a highly symmetric spacecraft environment to reduce signiﬁcantly electrostatic errors. These sensors are complemented with the EDI electric measurements that are free from all local spacecraft perturbations. Cross-calibrated vector electric ﬁeld measurements are thus produced from DC to 100 kHz, well beyond the upper hybrid resonance whose frequency provides an accurate determination of the local electron density. Due to its very large geometric factor, EDI also provides very high time resolution (∼ 1 ms) ambient electron ﬂux measurements at a few selected energies near 1 keV. This paper provides an overview of the FIELDS suite, its science objectives and measurement requirements, and its performance as veriﬁed in calibration and cross-calibration procedures that result in anticipated errors less than 0.1 nT in B and 0.5 mV/m in E. Summaries of data products that result from FIELDS are also described, as well as algorithms for cross-calibration. Details of the design and performance characteristics of AFG/DFG, SCM, ADP, SDP, and EDI are provided in ﬁve companion papers.},

	abstract = {We surveyed fast current sheet crossings (ﬂapping motions) over the distance range 10–30 RE in the magnetotail covered by the Geotail spacecraft. Since the local tilts of these dynamic sheets are large and variable in these events, we compare three different methods of evaluating current sheet normals using 4-s/c Cluster data and deﬁne the success criteria for the single-spacecraft-based method (MVA) to obtain the reliable results. Then, after identifying more than ∼ 1100 fast CS crossings over a 3-year period of Geotail observations in 1997–1999, we address their parameters, spatial distribution and activity dependence. We conﬁrm that over the entire distance covered and LT bins, fast crossings have considerable tilts in the YZ plane (from estimated MVA normals) which show a preferential appearance of one (YZ kinklike) mode that is responsible for these severe current sheet perturbations. Their occurrence is highly inhomogeneous; it sharply increases with radial distance and has a peak in the tail center (with some duskward shift), resembling the occurrence of the BBFs, although there is no one-to-one local correspondence between these two phenomena. The crossing durations typically spread around 1 min and decrease significantly where the high-speed ﬂows are registered. Based on an AE index superposed epoch study, the ﬂapping motions prefer to appear during the substorm expansion phase, although a considerable number of events without any electrojet and auroral activity were also observed. We also present statistical distributions of other parameters and brieﬂy discuss what could be possible mechanisms to generate the ﬂapping motions.},

	abstract = {Three‐dimensional global hybrid simulations and observations have shown that earthwardmoving ﬂux ropes (FRs) can undergo magnetic reconnection (or re‐reconnection) with the near‐Earth dipole ﬁeld to create dipolarization front (DF)‐like signatures that are immediately preceded by brief intervals of negative BZ. The simultaneous erosion of the southward BZ ﬁeld at the leading edge of the FR and continuous reconnection of lobe magnetic ﬂux at the X‐line tailward of the FR result in the asymmetric south‐north BZ signature in many earthward‐moving FRs and possibly DFs with negative BZ dips prior to their observation. In this study, we analyzed Magnetospheric MultiScale (MMS) observation of ﬁelds and plasma signatures associated with the encounter of an ion diffusion region ahead of an earthward‐moving FR on 3 August 2017. The signatures of this re‐reconnection event were (i) +/− BZ reversal, (ii) −/+ bipolar‐type quadrupolar Hall magnetic ﬁelds, (iii) northward super‐Alfvénic electron outﬂow jet of {\textasciitilde}1,000–1,500 km/s, (iv) Hall electric ﬁeld of {\textasciitilde}15 mV/m, (v) intense currents of {\textasciitilde}40–100 nA/m2, and (vi) J·E′ {\textasciitilde}0.11 nW/m3. Our analysis suggests that the MMS spacecraft encounters the ion and electron diffusion regions but misses the X‐line. Our results are in good agreement with particle‐in‐cell simulations of Lu et al. (2016, https://doi.org/10.1002/2016JA022815). We computed a dimensionless reconnection rate of {\textasciitilde}0.09 for this re‐reconnection event and through modeling, estimating that the FR would fully dissipate by −16.58 RE. We demonstrated pertubations in the high‐latitude ionospheric currents at the same time of the dissipation of earthward‐moving FRs using ground‐ and spacebased measurements.},

	abstract = {We describe methods for polynomial reconstruction of the magnetic field close to a cluster of spacecraft and apply that to reconstruction of the magnetic field observed during a magnetic reconnection event on 10 August 2017 by the Magnetospheric Multiscale spacecraft. Four different models are described, which vary in complexity between a 12-parameter linear model, which has only linear variation with respect to the spatial coordinates, and a 27-parameter quadratic model, which has the full quadratic expansion except that the second derivative with respect to the Minimum Directional Derivative minimum gradient coordinate m has been neglected. In contrast to previous reconstruction techniques, these reconstructions can be found using only the magnetic field and current density measured at a single time by the cluster of spacecraft. The equations satisfying ∇ · B = 0 are satisfied exactly, while the equations specifying the model fields at the spacecraft locations are satisfied for most models in a best least squares sense. For this magnetotail event, the models have very small errors in magnetic field components ({\textless}0.1 nT) at a distance from the nearest spacecraft on the order of the spacecraft separation, Lsc, here equal to 20.5 km. The magnetic structures found using the quadratic models are very time dependent, with a stretched field leading to plasmoid formation at one point in time.},

These both gradients play a crucial role for the stability of the current sheet. The instability occurs in the regions of the current layer where the multiplication of two gradients is negative. In particular, the instability can arise in a vicinity of a localized thinning of the current sheet (Fig. 4b). In stable regions, the ﬂapping waves are associated with the so called “Bursty Bulk Flows” or BBF’s [3], which are the magnetic tubes rapidly moving through the center of the current sheet towards the Earth. These BBF’s are considered to be the sources of the ﬂapping wave oscillations propagating from the center of the current sheet towards the ﬂanks in the ±y directions.},

Prior to the ﬁrst substorm, the motion of the plasma sheet with respect to Cluster was in the ZGSM direction. Observations following the substorms show the occurrence of current sheet waves moving predominantly in the −YGSM direction. Following the second substorm, the current sheet waves caused multiple current sheet crossings of the Cluster spacecraft, previously studied by Zhang et al. (2002). We further this study to show that the velocity of the current sheet waves was similar to the expansion velocity of the substorm aurora and the expansion of the dipolarization regions in the magnetotail. Furthermore, we compare these results with the current sheet wave models of Golovchanskaya and Maltsev (2005) and Erkaev et al. (2008). We ﬁnd that the Erkaev et al.

To explore the dynamic characteristics of current sheet associated with the ﬂapping motion holistically and provide reasonable physical interpretations, detailed direct calculation and analysis have been applied to one approximate analytic model of magnetic ﬁeld in the ﬂapping current sheet. The main results from the model demonstrate: (1) the magnetic ﬂuctuation amplitude is attenuated from the center of current sheet to the lobe regions; The larger wave amplitude would induce the larger magnetic amplitude; (2) the curvature of magnetic ﬁeld lines (MFLs), with maximum at the center of current sheet, is only dependent on the displacement Z along the south–north direction from the center of current sheet, regardless of the tilt of current sheet; (3) the half-thickness of neutral sheet, h, the minimum curvature radius of MFLs, Rcmin, and the tilt angle of current sheet, d, satisﬁes h¼ Rcmin cos d; (4) the gradient of magnetic strength forms a double-peak proﬁle, and the peak value would be more intense if the local current sheet is more tilted; (5) current density j and its jy, jz components reach the extremum at the center of CS. j and jz would be more intense if the local current sheet is more tilted, but it is not the case for jy; and (6) the ﬁeld-aligned component of current density mainly appears in the neutral sheet, and the sign of it would change alternatively as the ﬂapping waves passing by. To check the validity of the model, one simulation on the virtual measurements has been made, and the results are in well consistence with actual observations of Cluster.},

It is shown that two possible polarizations of symmetric and asymmetric modes (sausage and kink) exist where the growth rate of instabilities is positive. In addition, we demonstrate that a tearing instability might have a positive growth rate in thin anisotropic current sheets. The class of relatively fast wavy ﬂapping oscillations observed by Cluster is described. The main direction of wave motion coincides with the direction of the current and the typical velocity of this motion is comparable with the plasma drift velocity in the current sheet. The comparison of these characteristics with theoretical predictions of the model of anisotropic thin current sheets, demonstrates that, in principle, the theory adequately describes the observations.},

Large separation of spacecraft allows us to estimate both local and global properties of ﬂapping current sheets. We ﬁnd signiﬁcant variation in ﬂapping wave direction of propagation between the middle tail and ﬂanks. Th series of tilted current sheets represent the system of periodic, almost parallel currents with typical thickness of current ﬁlaments about L = 0.4 RE. The earthward gradients of Bz magnetic ﬁeld are reduced within this current system in comparison with the gradients in the quiet near-Earth magnetotail. The wavelength (i.e. a distance between two crossings of current sheets with the same orientations) of the ﬂapping waves is larger than 2π L for most of observations. The velocity of ﬂapping wave propagation is about ion bulk velocity and is signiﬁcantly lower than the velocity of ion drift relative to electrons. We discuss possible drivers of ﬂapping and estimate the amplitude of the total parallel current generated by ﬂapping waves.},

	abstract = {The Axial Double Probe (ADP) instrument measures the DC to ∼ 100 kHz electric ﬁeld along the spin axis of the Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) spacecraft (Burch et al., Space Sci. Rev., 2014, this issue), completing the vector electric ﬁeld when combined with the spin plane double probes (SDP) (Torbert et al., Space Sci. Rev., 2014, this issue, Lindqvist et al., Space Sci. Rev., 2014, this issue). Two cylindrical sensors are separated by over 30 m tip-to-tip, the longest baseline on an axial DC electric ﬁeld ever attempted in space. The ADP on each of the spacecraft consists of two identical, 12.67 m graphite coilable booms with second, smaller 2.25 m booms mounted on their ends. A signiﬁcant effort was carried out to assure that the potential ﬁeld of the MMS spacecraft acts equally on the two sensors and that photo- and secondary electron currents do not vary over the spacecraft spin. The ADP on MMS is expected to measure DC electric ﬁeld with a precision of ∼ 1 mV/m, a resolution of ∼ 25 µV/m, and a range of ∼ ±1 V/m in most of the plasma environments MMS will encounter. The Digital Signal Processing (DSP) units on the MMS spacecraft are designed to perform analog conditioning, analog-to-digital (A/D) conversion, and digital processing on the ADP, SDP, and search coil magnetometer (SCM) (Le Contel et al., Space Sci. Rev., 2014, this issue) signals. The DSP units include digital ﬁlters, spectral processing, a high-speed burst memory, a solitary structure detector, and data compression.},

	abstract = {The Fast Plasma Investigation (FPI) was developed for ﬂight on the Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission to measure the differential directional ﬂux of magnetospheric electrons and ions with unprecedented time resolution to resolve kinetic-scale plasma dynamics. This increased resolution has been accomplished by placing four dual 180-degree top hat spectrometers for electrons and four dual 180-degree top hat spectrometers for ions around the periphery of each of four MMS spacecraft. Using electrostatic ﬁeldof-view deﬂection, the eight spectrometers for each species together provide 4pi-sr ﬁeld-ofview with, at worst, 11.25-degree sample spacing. Energy/charge sampling is provided by swept electrostatic energy/charge selection over the range from 10 eV/q to 30000 eV/q. The eight dual spectrometers on each spacecraft are controlled and interrogated by a single block redundant Instrument Data Processing Unit, which in turn interfaces to the observatory’s Instrument Suite Central Instrument Data Processor. This paper describes the design of FPI, its ground and in-ﬂight calibration, its operational concept, and its data products.},

To demonstrate its usefulness as an indicator of magnetic topology, the new measure is calculated for electron data taken from numerical simulations of magnetic reconnection, shown to peak at separatrices and X points, and compared to the other measures. The new diagnostic has potential uses in analyzing spacecraft observations, and so a method for calculating it from measurements performed in an arbitrary coordinate system is derived.},

	abstract = {Magnetic reconnection is the crucial process in the release of magnetic energy previously stored in the magnetotail in association with substorms. However, energy transfer and dissipation in the vicinity of the reconnection site is only a minor part of the energy conversion. We discuss the energy release, transport, and conversion based on largescale resistive MHD simulations of magnetotail dynamics and more localized full particle simulations of reconnection. We address in particular, where the energy is released, how it propagates and where and how it is converted from one form into another. We ﬁnd that Joule (or ohmic) dissipation plays only a minor role in the overall energy transfer. Bulk kinetic energy, although locally signiﬁcant in the outﬂow from the reconnection site, plays a more important role as mediator or catalyst in the transfer between magnetic and thermal energy. Generator regions with potential auroral consequences are located primarily off the equatorial plane in the boundary regions of the plasma sheet.},

	abstract = {The role and properties of lower hybrid waves in the ion diﬀusion region and magnetospheric inﬂow region of asymmetric reconnection are investigated using the Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission. Two distinct groups of lower hybrid waves are observed in the ion diﬀusion region and magnetospheric inﬂow region, which have distinct properties and propagate in opposite directions along the magnetopause. One group develops near the ion edge in the magnetospheric inﬂow, where magnetosheath ions enter the magnetosphere through the ﬁnite gyroradius eﬀect and are driven by the ion-ion cross-ﬁeld instability due to the interaction between the magnetosheath ions and cold magnetospheric ions. This leads to heating of the cold magnetospheric ions. The second group develops at the sharpest density gradient, where the Hall electric ﬁeld is observed and is driven by the lower hybrid drift instability. These drift waves produce cross-ﬁeld particle diﬀusion, enabling magnetosheath electrons to enter the magnetospheric inﬂow region thereby broadening the density gradient in the ion diﬀusion region.},

We determine the magnetic conﬁguration of a particular subset of such phenomena: a series of sheet crossings, having signiﬁcantly differing inclinations and occurring during quiet conditions. These wave-like variations appear to propagate azimuthally and their magnetic amplitude and magnetic gradient (current density) inside the sheet are proportional to their steepness (degree of inlcination). In spite of signiﬁcant normal direction changes between neighboring crossings up to 150◦, the magnetic ﬁeld direction inside the neutral sheet remains almost constant. The wavelengths and spatial amplitudes are of the order of 2–5 RE. These observations are interpreted as crossings of a quasi-periodic dynamical structure produced by almost vertical slippage motion of the neighboring magnetic ﬂux tubes in the high-β plasma sheet, rather than large-scale ﬂapping of a stationary structure.},

However,in addition, there are (at least) two othertreatments ofthe four spacecraftdata which we feel will needroutine implementation. Here we identify and describe techniques that we call the ‘wave telescope’ and ‘discontinuity analysis’, as well as that estimating the current density, which we term the ‘curlometer’. Each technique involves a priori assumptions about the nature of signals detected on the spacecraft and, using parallels with other areas of geophysics, we outline a general strategy for approaching the analysis of multipoint data.},
